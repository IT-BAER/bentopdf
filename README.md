## 🚀 Getting Started

PDF-Tools can be installed and run in multiple ways depending on your needs.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
- Linux server (Debian/Ubuntu for automated install script)

### 🚀 Quick Install (Debian/Ubuntu - Recommended)

The easiest way to install PDF-Tools as a production service on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Download and run the install script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IT-BAER/bentopdf/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IT-BAER/bentopdf.git
cd bentopdf

# Run the install script
sudo ./install.sh
```

This will:
- Install Node.js v20 if not present
- Create a dedicated `pdftools` system user
- Build the application
- Set up a systemd service running on port 3000
- Enable auto-start on boot

**After installation:**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status pdf-tools

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u pdf-tools -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart pdf-tools
```

**To update to the latest version:**
```bash
sudo ./install.sh --update
# or
sudo ./install.sh -u
```

**To uninstall:**
```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

### 🛠️ Manual Installation

For development or custom setups:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IT-BAER/bentopdf.git
cd bentopdf

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Serve the dist folder
npx serve dist
```

Access at: `http://localhost:3000`

### 🏠 Self-Hosting (Static Files)

Since PDF-Tools is fully client-side, you can host it as static files on any web server.

**Download from Releases:**

1. Go to [PDF-Tools Releases](https://github.com/IT-BAER/bentopdf/releases)
2. Download the latest `dist-{version}.zip` file
3. Extract and serve with any web server

```bash
# Navigate to the extracted folder
cd dist

# Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js
npx serve .

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

### 🔧 Configuration

**Change the port:**

If installed via the install script, edit the service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pdf-tools.service
# Change the port number in the ExecStart line
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart pdf-tools
```

Or set the port during installation:
```bash
PDF_TOOLS_PORT=8080 sudo ./install.sh
```

### 🏢 Simple Mode for Internal Use

For organizations that want a clean, distraction-free interface focused solely on PDF tools, PDF-Tools supports a **Simple Mode** that hides all branding and marketing content.

- Updates page title to "PDF Tools"
- Perfect for internal company tools and educational institutions

For more details, see [SIMPLE_MODE.md](SIMPLE_MODE.md).

### 🔒 Security Features

When running as a systemd service, PDF-Tools includes several security hardening features:

- **Dedicated User**: Runs under a non-privileged `pdftools` system user
- **Restricted Permissions**: Uses systemd's `NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`, and `ProtectSystem` directives
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: Most of the system is mounted read-only
- **Auto-Restart**: Service automatically restarts on failure
